- 👋 Hi, I’m @festinalente - Tomás Swift-Metcalfe 
- 👀 I’m in love programming, learning, remaking the wheel if I can make it better or learn something along the way. 
I'm a former pro cyclist and small business owner with qualifications (BSc) in Sports Science, Sports Technology and
cycling coaching. Software-wise see more at [https://appyou.pro](appyou.pro) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, building C++ addons forr Node.js, I'm in love! Starting this journey with JavaScript 
was *brutal* way into programming.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I love sport, have experience building "Strava like" app, have a 
lot of knowledge on sport and human performance, as well as basically anything using maps (e.g. routing) 
- 📫 How to reach me tomas@appyou.pro
