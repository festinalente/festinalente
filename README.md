- 👋 Hi, I’m @festinalente - Tomás Swift-Metcalfe 
- 👀 I’m in love programming, learning, remaking the wheel if I can make it better or learn something along the way. 
I'm a former pro cyclist and small business owner with qualifications (BSc) in Sports Science, Sports Technology and
cycling coaching. Software-wise you can see a summary of my various projects and how I undertook them at [https://appyou.pro](appyou.pro) Following my needs to set up a business online at the time (2012-2014). I started my programming journey learning JavaScript and hacking in PHP for various purposes. Nowadays I use either Node.js,  C++, building C++ addons for Node.js, for most of my projects. 
- 🌱 Currently I'm dabbling in ML with Tensorflow after several years of learning about it from an academic perspective: It's a lot of fun and solves fuzzy, NP hard problems quite well.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a job in software I can apply these skills. I particularly love writing software to be applied in the realms health, fitness, sport or the arts. I have experience building "Strava like" app, and a bicycle rental management system and a full e-commerce PWA an example of which can be found at https://jewelkat.studio, which I shall publish this under an open source license in the near future. By concequence, I have a lot of experience with apps anything using maps (OSRM, Leaflet) and setting up services, either self hosted or various cloud services like Google Cloud Platform, Heroku and Openstack.
