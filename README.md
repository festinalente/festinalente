- 👋 Hi, I’m @festinalente - Tomás Swift-Metcalfe 
- 👀 I’m in love programming, learning, remaking the wheel if I can make it better or learn something along the way. 
I'm a former pro cyclist and small business owner with qualifications (BSc) in Sports Science, Sports Technology and
cycling coaching. Software-wise see more at [https://appyou.pro](appyou.pro) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, building C++ addons for Node.js, I'm in love! I starting this journey with JavaScript 
was *brutal* way into programming.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I particularly love working in the realms health, fitness, sport or the arts. I have experience building "Strava like" app, and a bicycle rental management system and a full e-commerce PWA an example of which can be found at https://jewelkat.studio, which I shall publish this under an open source license in the near future. By concequence, I have a lot of experience with apps anything using maps (OSRM, Leaflet) and setting up services, either self hosted or various cloud services like Google Cloud Platform, Heroku and Openstack.
